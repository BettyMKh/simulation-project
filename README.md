# simulation-project
Simulated two systems — a bank queuing model and a newspaper inventory model — to optimize performance and profit. The bank model showed that adding a dedicated teller reduced waiting times, while the newspaper model identified 70 papers per day as the profit-maximizing supply. Demonstrated the use of simulation for data-driven decision-making.
